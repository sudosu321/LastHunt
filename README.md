LAST HUNT
---
>a curious explorer go to the woods but ends up getting trapped in an abandoned research facility gaurded by an advance security animatronics , can he make his way out alive or is it going to be his last every hunt !

Yepp thats the story line i have decied for this little game ,
you start from a ware house and solve little big puzzles to find your way out 
the scene (map ) of the building is small but will surely expand it more 

the robot ai works on navmesh agent 
it can detect gunshot and can come right often 
dont every think of sprinting when its near 
it works on detecting the player by sending raycasts in all the directions and check whether it hits then it detects the player
i force playerdetection methods when not in raycast but sprinting or gunshot is detected 


Dont worry its ongoing poject will improve textures and add juice (sounds interactables)

******
those who will be playing herea are hints 
>find the feul for turining the main generator then the metal door can be opened
>then to turn the panel you need to find a red plug
>the panel can also activate the robot so watch ouy
>then you need to find plasma cubes to power the plasma syntesizer (childish ik) and this will power other panels (3 panels in total) find them and turn them on
>now you will be able to exit main hall , then you have to find a supercomputer to enter the seriel code for the robot , seriel code can be found in its stomach , only visible when its shot (3 times)
>shoot the robot near stomach cuz its head doesnt have a collider yet
>entering the serial code will turn the securtiy for 60 sec and you will be able to escape

******
That was it I will expand the map and add more puzzles and also optimize the game as much as possible
Thanks for Reading <33
